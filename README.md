 we implemented a model to predict the market price of a nonlinear chaotic time series,using reinforcement learning
Our model is based on a multi-layer neural network, using reinforcement learning, in particular a learning algorithm called Stochastic Gradient Ascent (SGA).
The proposed system includes 4 layers: input layer,hidden layer, stochastic parameter layerandoutputlayer. Inordertooptimizetheweightsandhaveapreciseprediction,we used a stochastic policy.
In simulation, and to have a general model, we generate an artiﬁcial nonlinear data using Lorenz system. Then, to further test the efﬁciency of our model, we test it on real data.
By the end, we used the simulation result, and compared short-term prediction accuracy of our proposed method with classical learning method.
